I'm a hands‑on software architect and tech lead focused on building reliable, scalable, and delightful products across mobile and web. I lead end‑to‑end delivery, mentor engineers, and care deeply about clean architecture, developer experience, and pragmatic execution.

— Based in Canada · Open to interesting engineering leadership and IC opportunities.

## Core Strengths

- System design: modular, testable architectures for Android, iOS, and web
- Full‑stack execution: Java/Kotlin, Swift, React/Next.js, APIs, data
- Delivery leadership: roadmap shaping, code reviews, mentorship, quality gates
- Reliability: performance tuning, crash reduction, observability, CI/CD pipelines

## Tech Stack

- Languages: Java, Kotlin, Swift, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Mobile: Android (Jetpack, Coroutines), iOS (Swift, UIKit/SwiftUI)
- Web: React, Next.js
- Data: SQLite, MySQL, Firebase
- Tooling: Git, Linux, Gradle, Xcode, Node.js

## How I Work

- Start from outcomes, design the simplest architecture that scales
- Prefer boring tech used well over novelty; automate the rest
- Write code that's easy to delete, document decisions, leave the campsite cleaner
